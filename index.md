##Favorite CPSC Labs

Lab 4, Part 1
One of my Favorite labs was lab 4 this is where we had to use the edit-compile-run -test-release cycle to write a line of code. I liked this la because this is when i started to get more used to coding and my partner was teaching me alot and helping me get used to it

Lab 10, part 1
One of my other Favorite labs was lab 10, In this la we wrote code using 2D vectors and we were able to use Unit test to help guide us in developing our projects. I liked this because it was a good mix of challenging yet fast to complete.

Lab 11 Part 1
In this lab we wrote about States and there population Density using member function definitions for object oriented classes. We were also able to write code that generates random numbers. I enjoying this lab because it was a really challenging yet fun lab that had me and my partner struggling to complete
